# Progress Log

## 2026-02-05
### Task 1: Install @clerk/testing package (COMPLETED)
- Installed @clerk/testing@1.13.35 as dev dependency in frontend
- Verified it appears in frontend/package.json devDependencies at line 30
- Lockfile updated via bun install
- Quality gates: typecheck passes, lint has warnings only (no errors)

### Task 3: Create global-setup.ts for Clerk testing token initialization (COMPLETED)
- Created frontend/tests/e2e/global-setup.ts
- Imports clerkSetup from @clerk/testing/playwright
- Exports default async function that calls await clerkSetup()
- Typecheck passes, lint passes (no errors)
- Playwright test --list confirms config parses correctly

Note: Backend tests (`bun test`) and frontend tests (`bun test --cwd frontend`) have pre-existing failures:
- Backend: @effect/vitest compatibility issue with `ctx?.onTestFinished is not a function`
- Frontend: vitest is picking up Playwright e2e tests causing errors, also missing jsdom environment for component tests
These are pre-existing issues not related to this change.

### Task 2: Create .env.test file with test credentials (COMPLETED)
- Created frontend/.env.test with E2E test credentials:
  - E2E_CLERK_USER_USERNAME=test@testee.com
  - E2E_CLERK_USER_PASSWORD=testtest
- Included CLERK keys from existing .env file
- Verified file is readable: `cat frontend/.env.test | grep E2E_CLERK` shows expected values
- Quality gates: typecheck passes, lint has warnings only (no errors)
