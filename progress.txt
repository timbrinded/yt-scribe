## Progress Log

### 2026-02-01 - Project Initialization

**Completed:** Task 1 - Initialize Bun project with TypeScript, Biome linting, and Vitest testing

**What was done:**
- Initialized Bun project with `bun init`
- Installed dev dependencies: typescript, vitest, @biomejs/biome
- Created tsconfig.json with strict mode and additional strict flags (noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters)
- Created biome.json with recommended rules (uses tabs for indentation)
- Created vitest.config.ts with node environment
- Added scripts to package.json: typecheck, test, test:watch, lint, format
- Created tests/setup.test.ts as a placeholder test

**Quality gates verified:**
- `bun run typecheck` - passes
- `bun run lint` - passes
- `bun test` - passes (1 test)

**Notes for next task:**
- Next priority: Task 2 - Set up Drizzle ORM with SQLite and create initial schema for users table
- The project uses tabs for indentation (biome default)
- All files formatted with `bun run format` before committing

### 2026-02-01 - Drizzle ORM Setup

**Completed:** Task 2 - Set up Drizzle ORM with SQLite and create initial schema for users table

**What was done:**
- Installed drizzle-orm (runtime) and drizzle-kit, @libsql/client (dev, for drizzle-kit migrations)
- Created src/db/schema.ts with users table (id, email, name, avatarUrl, createdAt)
- Created src/db/index.ts using bun:sqlite (per CLAUDE.md recommendation) with WAL mode enabled
- Created drizzle.config.ts pointing to schema with sqlite dialect
- Added db:push and db:generate scripts to package.json
- Ran `bun run db:push` to create data/ytscribe.db
- Verified database file exists with proper users table schema

**Quality gates verified:**
- `bun run typecheck` - passes
- `bun run lint` - passes
- `bun test` - passes (1 test)

**Notes for next task:**
- Next priority: Add videos table schema with foreign key to users
- Using bun:sqlite for runtime (per CLAUDE.md), @libsql/client only for drizzle-kit tooling
- Database stored at data/ytscribe.db (can override with DATABASE_URL env var)
- Schema exports User and NewUser types for type-safe operations
