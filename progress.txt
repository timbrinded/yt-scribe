### Task 1: Install @clerk/testing package (COMPLETED)
- Installed @clerk/testing@1.13.35 as dev dependency in frontend
- Verified it appears in frontend/package.json devDependencies at line 30
- Lockfile updated via bun install
- Quality gates: typecheck passes, lint has warnings only (no errors)

Note: Backend tests (`bun test`) and frontend tests (`bun test --cwd frontend`) have pre-existing failures:
- Backend: @effect/vitest compatibility issue with `ctx?.onTestFinished is not a function`
- Frontend: vitest is picking up Playwright e2e tests causing errors, also missing jsdom environment for component tests
These are pre-existing issues not related to this change.
